    "1. What is anomaly detection and what is its purpose?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Anomaly detection is used to detect outliers in the clustering algorithm. Its main aim is to identify rare and unexpected events. Sometimes these unforeseen events can be helpful. "

    "2. What are the key challenges in anomaly detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In the real world, data are more complex and contain noise and heterogeneity, which makes it very difficult to identify patterns and separate normal behaviour from anomalies. "

    "\n",
    "Ans: In supervised learning, label data is available during the technique, which helps the algorithm to learn the anomaly's behaviour. Label data is available in supervised learning, so the algorithm learns the anomalies and flags rare and unknown data."

    "\n",
    "Ans: Distance-based anomaly detection methods assume that a dataset's expected data points are tightly clustered in the feature space. In contrast, anomalies are located far away from the standard data points. These methods aim to identify anomalies by measuring the distances between data points and identifying those significantly different from the majority of the data points based on some distance metric."

    "6. How does the LOF algorithm compute anomaly scores?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The LOF (Local Outlier Factor) algorithm computes anomaly scores by measuring the local density of a data point compared to its k-nearest neighbours. It calculates the ratio between the average density of a point's k-nearest neighbours and its local density. The point is considered an outlier if this ratio is less than 1. The lower the ratio, the more anomalous the point."

Other important parameters include the sub-sampling size (max_samples), the splitting strategy (splitter), and the random seed (random_state)."
